# RTA-analysis
Analyzed 12K+ road accidents using Python to uncover patterns in severity, driver age, and vehicle type. Visualized trends and laid groundwork for predictive modeling to support road safety decisions.
🚧 Road Traffic Accident Analysis with Python
I analyzed a dataset of 12,000+ road traffic accidents to uncover patterns in severity, driver profiles, and vehicle types.

🔍 Key Focus:
-Cleaned and explored 32 features using Pandas & NumPy

-Visualized trends with Seaborn & Matplotlib

-Identified high-risk age groups, vehicle types, and accident causes

The project revealed that younger drivers and heavy vehicles are often linked to serious injuries, especially during overtaking or lane changes.
